## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Current Setup (Demo Mode):
- Data is stored in browser LocalStorage
- Each user has their own separate data
- Data doesn't sync between devices
- Perfect for testing and demonstration

### For Production Use:
You'll eventually need:
1. Backend server for centralized data storage
2. Database (MongoDB, Firebase, or PostgreSQL)
3. API integrations (Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio)
4. Secure authentication system

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you see a 404 error:
1. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled (see Step 2 above)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for initial deployment
3. Clear your browser cache and try again

### If images don't load:
1. Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. Check that you're using the correct URL

### If styles look broken:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Make sure you're accessing via HTTPS (not HTTP)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Enable GitHub Pages (follow Step 2 above)
2. ✅ Test all pages on the live site
3. ✅ Share the URL with your team
4. ✅ Add real student data
5. ✅ Customize branding and colors
6. ⏳ Consider custom domain (optional)
7. ⏳ Plan for backend integration (for production)

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the GitHub Pages deployment status in Settings > Pages
2. Look for error messages in your browser's console (F12)
3. Verify all files were pushed correctly on GitHub
